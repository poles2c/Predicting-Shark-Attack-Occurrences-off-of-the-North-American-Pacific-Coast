ï¿¼1.  The project hopes to answer when shark attacks are most likely to occur off of the North American Pacific coast, and what important factors causes them to occur.  Prevention of this type of case in the future is also a topic of discussion in this project.

2.  I plan on using data gathered by research that shows past trends of when shark attacks are most likely to occur.

3.  The data gives a clear picture of shark attacks within the last approximately thirty years, and how these attacks occurred.  

4.  I chose this topic because I believe it would be a useful occurrence to be able to predict in order to lessen tragedies of this sort.

- There have been a total of 211 shark attacks off of the North American Pacific Coast since 1990.
