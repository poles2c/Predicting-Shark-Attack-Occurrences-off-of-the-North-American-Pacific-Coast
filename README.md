ï¿¼1.  The project will answer when shark attacks are most likely to occur off of the North American Pacific coast, and what important factors cause them to occur.  Prevention of this type of case in the future is also a topic of discussion in this project.

2.  I plan on using data gathered by research that shows past trends of when shark attacks are most likely to occur.

3.  The data gives a clear picture of shark attacks within the last approximately thirty years, and how these attacks occurred.  

4.  I chose this topic because I believe it would be a useful occurrence to be able to predict in order to lessen tragedies of this sort.

- There have been a total of 211 shark attacks on people off of the North American Pacific Coast since 1990.

5.  I have gathered data explaining what events (independent variables) cause shark attacks (dependent variables) to occur.  I have gathered it through research of articles that provide insight on this matter.

6. I have explored the data since acquiring it.  Some insights gained include when shark attacks are most likely to occur, why shark attacks occur, and common victims of shark attacks.

7.  I am optimistic I will be able to answer this question thoroughly with the data I have researched and acquired.  No adjustment to the question will be necessary based on the resources I have.

8.  I will be using the Linear Regression modeling approach to answer this question.



                  Data Science Project: Predicting Shark Attacks off of the North American Pacific Coast
                  
                                                                                                                                     
    Shark Attacks on people are a reality, and a potentially dangerous situation when they occur.  Since 1990, there have been over 200 shark attacks recorded on humans on the north american pacific coast.  A predictive way to capture this event could help contribute to reducing the number of its occurences.  This source will answer when shark attacks are most likely to occur, explain what important factors cause them to occur, and provide many other useful resources to dive further into this important topic.
