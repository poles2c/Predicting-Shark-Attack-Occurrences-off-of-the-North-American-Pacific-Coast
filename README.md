ï¿¼1.  The project will answer when shark attacks are most likely to occur off of the North American Pacific coast, and what important factors cause them to occur.  Prevention of this type of case in the future is also a topic of discussion in this project.

2.  I plan on using data gathered by research that shows past trends of when shark attacks are most likely to occur.

3.  The data gives a clear picture of shark attacks within the last approximately thirty years, and how these attacks occurred.  

4.  I chose this topic because I believe it would be a useful occurrence to be able to predict in order to lessen tragedies of this sort.

- There have been a total of 211 shark attacks on people off of the North American Pacific Coast since 1990.

5.  I have gathered data explaining what events (independent variables) cause shark attacks (dependent variables) to occur.  I have gathered it through research of articles that provide insight on this matter.

6. I have explored the data since acquiring it.  Some insights gained include when shark attacks are most likely to occur, why shark attacks occur, and common victims of shark attacks.

7.  I am optimistic I will be able to answer this question thoroughly with the data I have researched and acquired.  No adjustment to the question will be necessary based on the resources I have.

8.  I will be using the Linear Regression modeling approach to answer this question.

    Shark Attacks on people are a reality, and a potentially dangerous situation when they occur.  Since 1990, there have been over 200 shark attacks recorded on humans on the north american pacific coast.  A predictive way to capture this event could help contribute to reducing the number of its occurences.  This source will answer when shark attacks are most likely to occur, explain what important factors cause them to occur, and provide many other useful resources to dive further into this important topic.  
  Let's first identify the demographics of the human population affected by shark attacks.  Victim age was available for 91 of the 108 recorded cases on the north american pacific coast during the twentieth century. The average age of a shark attack victim in these 91 cases was 29 years old.  The four major activities associated with this population during the shark attacks were related to surfing, kayaking, swimming, and diving.  Of these four activities, surfing and diving made up most of the victim group.  84% of the shark attack victims were either surfing or diving during the time of attack.  Jet skiing is anticipated to become the next victim group at some point.  
  When are shark attacks most likely to occur?  Statistics show attacks on humans occur in every month of the calender year, with a dramatic peak in August, September, and October.  Diving is very popular in these months, as underwater visibility and water temperature is very manageable during this time.  Shark attacks are caused by a variety of factors.  Surfers and divers have been prone to shark attacks when surfing and diving near large fish populations, and invading sharks personal space.  Water depth has also been a factor in shark attack occurences.  Most shark attacks have occured in the epipelagic zone, which includes the surface of the ocean, and two hundred meters below the surface.  One to 10 fathoms is more specific depth range where shark attacks are most likely to occur.  Divers collecting and in possession of marine organisms have proven to be very susceptible to shark attacks.  
  What types of sharks have been the major culprit of shark attacks?  Great white sharks is the dominant shark species that attacks people on a regular basis.  Below is a histogram that gives substance to this statement.  Some shark attack cases go unknown in identifying the responsible shark specie.  A small portion of shark attacks can be attributed to hammerhead and blue sharks.  
  What can be done to prevent shark attacks in the future?  Engaging in ocean activities in daylight, and staying in groups have proven to decrease the chances of shark attacks that cause injuries and even fatalities.  In addition, obtaining an odor that may not be attractive to a shark may also help keep this fish away at inopportune times.  Shark populations have increased substantially in the last ten years due to protection of this type of fish.  This increase has caused more shark attacks on humans in the last decade, and a need to investigate more impactful ways to prevent shark attacks.
